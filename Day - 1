# Introduction to Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, and other threats. It encompasses a range of measures and technologies designed to safeguard the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information and services.

## Network Security
Network security involves protecting an organization's infrastructure from unauthorized access, cyber threats, and attacks. It includes implementing firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), virtual private networks (VPNs), and encryption to safeguard data transmission. Proper network segmentation and continuous monitoring help prevent breaches and ensure secure communication.

## Application Security
Application security focuses on securing software and applications from vulnerabilities and exploits. It involves secure coding practices, regular security testing (such as penetration testing and vulnerability assessments), and the use of Web Application Firewalls (WAF). Proper authentication, authorization, and patch management help mitigate risks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflow attacks.

## Endpoint Security
Endpoint security protects individual devices such as computers, mobile phones, and IoT devices from cyber threats. It includes antivirus software, endpoint detection and response (EDR), data encryption, and device control policies. Ensuring that all endpoints are regularly updated and monitored helps prevent malware infections, phishing attacks, and unauthorized access.

## Email Security
Email security involves protecting email communications from phishing, spam, malware, and data breaches. It includes the use of secure email gateways, spam filters, encryption, and multi-factor authentication (MFA). Implementing policies like Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) helps prevent email spoofing and ensures safe email communication.

## Infrastructure Security vs Cybersecurity
### Infrastructure Security
Infrastructure Security focuses on protecting physical and digital assets like servers, networks, data centers, and cloud environments from threats such as unauthorized access, hardware failures, and natural disasters. It includes measures like firewalls, access controls, and disaster recovery plans.

### Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity, on the other hand, is a broader field that encompasses protecting all digital systems, including networks, applications, data, and users, from cyber threats like malware, phishing, and hacking. It includes infrastructure security but also covers areas like application security, endpoint security, and threat intelligence.

# OSI Model: 7 Layers of Networking
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes network communication by dividing it into 7 layers. Each layer has a specific function in data transmission.

## 1. Physical Layer (Layer 1)
- Deals with raw data transmission via cables, signals, and hardware.
- **Examples:** Ethernet cables, fiber optics, radio waves, hubs, and repeaters.

## 2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
- Manages direct node-to-node data transfer and error detection.
- **Divided into:**
  - **MAC (Media Access Control):** Manages physical addressing (MAC addresses).
  - **LLC (Logical Link Control):** Handles error checking and flow control.
- **Examples:** Switches, MAC addresses, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).

## 3. Network Layer (Layer 3)
- Responsible for routing data between different networks.
- Uses IP addressing for identifying devices.
- **Examples:** Routers, IP addresses, ICMP (ping), and OSPF.

## 4. Transport Layer (Layer 4)
- Ensures reliable or fast data delivery between devices.
- Uses two main protocols:
  - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Reliable, connection-oriented.
  - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Faster but unreliable, connectionless.
- **Examples:** TCP, UDP, port numbers.

## 5. Session Layer (Layer 5)
- Manages, establishes, and terminates communication sessions between applications.
- **Examples:** Session management in WebRTC, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

## 6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
- Converts data into a readable format (encryption, compression, encoding).
- **Examples:** SSL/TLS (encryption), JPEG, MP3, GIF, ASCII.

## 7. Application Layer (Layer 7)
- Directly interacts with users and applications (web browsers, emails, etc.).
- **Examples:** HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP (email), DNS.

## Summary Table
| Layer | Function | Example Protocols |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **7. Application** | User interaction | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS |
| **6. Presentation** | Data formatting & encryption | SSL/TLS, JPEG, ASCII |
| **5. Session** | Manages communication sessions | RDP, NetBIOS |
| **4. Transport** | Ensures reliable data transfer | TCP, UDP |
| **3. Network** | Routing & addressing | IP, ICMP, OSPF |
| **2. Data Link** | MAC addressing & error detection | Ethernet, MAC, ARP |
| **1. Physical** | Hardware & signal transmission | Cables, Wi-Fi, Hubs |
