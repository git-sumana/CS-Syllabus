The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) models are foundational frameworks that describe how data is transmitted across networks. They break down the complex process into distinct layers, each responsible for specific functions like addressing, routing, and error checking.The key difference is in the number of layers and their grouping:OSI Model (7 Layers)TCP/IP Model (4/5 Layers)7. Application4. Application (Combines OSI Layers 5, 6, 7)6. Presentation5. Session4. Transport3. Transport (Host-to-Host)3. Network2. Internet (Similar to OSI Layer 3)2. Data Link1. Network Access (Combines OSI Layers 1 & 2)1. PhysicalData Flow: Encapsulation and DecapsulationData transfer involves a process called encapsulation on the sender's side and decapsulation on the receiver's side.1. Encapsulation (Sender Side)As the data moves down the stack from the Application layer to the Physical layer:Each layer adds its own specific control information, known as a Header (and sometimes a Trailer at the Data Link layer).This header/trailer is prepended/appended to the data unit received from the layer above, a process that wraps the data.The resulting unit of data at each layer is called a Protocol Data Unit (PDU).2. Decapsulation (Receiver Side)As the data moves up the stack from the Physical layer to the Application layer:Each layer strips off and reads its corresponding header/trailer to determine what to do with the data (e.g., check for errors, forward, or deliver).The remaining data unit is then passed up to the next layer.This continues until the original data is presented to the receiving application.Layer-Specific Headers and PDUsThe most critical headers for network communication occur at the Transport, Internet, and Network Access (Data Link) layers.Model/LayerPDU NameHeader/Trailer DetailsKey ProtocolsTransport (OSI L4 / TCP/IP L3)Segment (TCP) or Datagram (UDP)Port Numbers (Source & Destination), Sequence Number, Acknowledgment Number, Window Size, Checksum.TCP (reliable), UDP (unreliable)Internet / Network (OSI L3 / TCP/IP L2)PacketIP Addresses (Source & Destination), Time To Live (TTL), Protocol Type, Header Checksum.IP (IPv4/IPv6)Data Link / Network Access (OSI L2 / TCP/IP L1)FrameHeader: MAC Addresses (Source & Destination), Frame Type.
