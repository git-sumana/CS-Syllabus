Excellent question 👏 — and a very smart one to ask before diving deep.

The topics you’ve listed are **a solid foundation for a beginner SOC Analyst (0–1 year)**, but for **2 years of experience**, you’re expected to go **beyond fundamentals** — into **hands-on security operations**, **advanced log analysis**, **SIEM management**, and **threat intelligence correlation**.

Let’s break it down properly.

---

## 🎯 Goal: SOC Analyst – 2 Years of Experience

You should be able to:

* Confidently monitor, analyze, and respond to security incidents.
* Work independently in SIEM (like Splunk or Azure Sentinel).
* Understand attacker techniques (MITRE ATT&CK).
* Automate repetitive analysis tasks with Python or playbooks.
* Generate and interpret threat intelligence.

## 🧭 COMPLETE SYLLABUS for 2-YEAR SOC SKILL LEVEL

### 🧩 **MODULE 1: Networking & Protocols (Deep Practical)**

> Duration: 2–3 weeks

**Learn**

* OSI & TCP/IP models in detail (headers, packet flow)
* Subnetting, routing, ARP, DHCP
* DNS deep dive (records, DNSSEC, tunneling)
* HTTP/HTTPS + encryption negotiation (TLS handshake)
* VPN protocols: IPSec, SSL, IKEv2
* Firewall architectures (NGFW, WAF, proxy, cloud firewalls)
* IDS/IPS detection mechanisms (signatures, heuristics, anomaly detection)

**Hands-on**

* Wireshark packet capture and analysis
* Set up simple pfSense firewall
* Simulate DNS/HTTP traffic and analyze packets
* Deploy Suricata/Snort and generate test alerts

---

### 🧠 **MODULE 2: SIEM & Log Analysis (Core SOC Skill)**

> Duration: 3–4 weeks

**Learn**

* What SIEM does, architecture overview
* Log sources: Windows, Linux, Firewall, IDS, Cloud
* Log parsing, normalization, and correlation
* Rule creation, alert tuning, and false positive reduction
* Detection engineering basics (writing detection logic)
* MITRE ATT&CK mapping

**Hands-on (choose one SIEM)**

* Splunk → create dashboards, correlation searches
* Azure Sentinel → KQL queries, analytics rules, playbooks
* Wazuh → open-source SIEM setup and alerting

---

### 🔍 **MODULE 3: Threat Analysis & Detection**

> Duration: 3 weeks

**Learn**

* UEBA (behavior-based detection)
* Phishing analysis (header, URL, payload, sandbox)
* Malware analysis (static/dynamic)
* Threat Hunting concepts (hypothesis, IOCs, TTPs)
* Threat Intel sources (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, AlienVault OTX, MISP)
* Incident Response lifecycle (NIST model)

**Hands-on**

* Analyze phishing emails
* Extract and validate IoCs
* Use VirusTotal / Hybrid Analysis / Any.Run
* Build simple threat hunt queries (in Splunk/Sentinel)

---

### ⚙️ **MODULE 4: Security Tools Mastery**

> Duration: 4 weeks

**Learn and use**

* **Network**: Wireshark, Nmap, tcpdump
* **Endpoint**: Sysmon, Velociraptor, ELK Stack
* **SIEM**: Splunk / Sentinel / Wazuh
* **Forensics**: Autopsy, FTK Imager
* **Threat Intel**: MISP, OTX
* **Ticketing/Case Mgmt**: ServiceNow, JIRA, TheHive

**Goal:** Be able to use at least 4–5 tools confidently in real incident scenarios.

---

### 💻 **MODULE 5: Scripting & Automation**

> Duration: 3 weeks

**Python**

* Parse log files
* Regex-based IOC extraction
* Call APIs (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB)
* Automate alert enrichment

**PowerShell / Bash**

* System info collection scripts
* Basic endpoint triage automation

**SIEM Automation**

* Azure Sentinel Logic Apps
* Splunk SOAR / Cortex XSOAR overview

---

### ☁️ **MODULE 6: Platforms & Cloud Security**

> Duration: 3 weeks

**Windows Server**

* Event ID 4624, 4625, 4672, etc.
* Group Policy & AD attacks basics (Kerberoasting, Pass-the-Hash)

**Linux Server**

* Syslog, auth logs, and auditd monitoring
* SSH brute force and log correlation

**Cloud (Azure, AWS basics)**

* IAM roles and access keys
* CloudTrail / Azure Activity logs
* Cloud attack scenarios (e.g., exposed storage buckets, privilege escalation)

---

### 🧱 **MODULE 7: Frameworks & Methodologies**

> Duration: 2 weeks

**Learn**

* MITRE ATT&CK Framework
* Cyber Kill Chain
* NIST SP 800-61 IR Framework
* ISO 27001 and basic compliance ideas
* SOC playbook structure

---

### 🔬 **MODULE 8: Projects & Real-World Simulation**

> Duration: 3–4 weeks

**Mini Projects**

1. Build a **Home SOC Lab** using VirtualBox or Wazuh.
2. Perform **attack simulation** using Atomic Red Team or Metasploit and detect it in SIEM.
3. Write **custom detection rules** for a brute force or phishing event.
4. Create an **incident response report** (timeline, logs, root cause, mitigation).
5. Automate a **threat enrichment script** using VirusTotal API.

---

## 📈 OPTIONAL ADVANCED SKILLS (2+ yrs Advantage)

* **Splunk SPL / KQL mastery**
* **SOAR Automation (Cortex, Splunk SOAR)**
* **EDR tools** (CrowdStrike, Defender for Endpoint)
* **Threat Intelligence correlation**
* **MITRE ATT&CK mapping to SIEM detections**

---

## 🕒 Recommended Total Duration: 6–8 months (realistic pace)

> 1–1.5 hrs per day on alternate days (as you’ve been doing).
> Practice > Theory. Build hands-on labs often.

Would you like me to turn this into a **chronological 6-month roadmap (week-by-week learning plan)** for SOC Analyst Level-2 (≈2 years experience)?
That plan would include what to study each week, which labs/tools to practice, and when to revise or do projects.
